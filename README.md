## What's Exercism?

Exercism is an online platform designed to help anyone master programming skills for free, without feeling lost or overwhelmed. Its purpose is to enable people from all backgrounds to become proficient in programming, contributing to their social mobility. Exercism emphasizes the joy and satisfaction of becoming a fluent programmer and aims to make the learning process empowering, enjoyable, and non-competitive. It prioritizes a nurturing, safe, and collaborative learning environment, focusing on the learning journey rather than just factual correctness. The platform is community-driven, with a small core team supported by donations, and offers the opportunity to develop fluency in 67 programming languages through a combination of learning, practice, and mentoring​​​​​​​​​​.
